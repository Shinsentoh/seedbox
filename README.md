# Seedbox

A collection of Dockerfiles and a docker-compose configuration to set up a
seedbox and personal media server.
This seedbox setup is based on the excellent work from jfroment (https://github.com/jfroment/seedbox) which I customized to fit my usage, and hopefully yours :)

## Dependencies

Linux OS using apt-get to get packages and bash as a shell.

- [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) >= 1.13.0
    + Install guidelines for Ubuntu 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) >=v1.10.0
    + Install guidelines for Ubuntu 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04
- [local-persist Docker plugin](https://github.com/CWSpear/local-persist): installed directly on host (not in container). This is a volume plugin that extends the default local driverâ€™s functionality by allowing you specify a mountpoint anywhere on the host, which enables the files to always persist, even if the volume is removed via `docker volume rm`. Use *systemd* install for Ubuntu 16.04.

## Fresh Server installation

If you want to install those containers on a brand new linux server with a running linux OS (see Dependencies), run those commands:
```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/Shinsentoh/seedbox.git /opt/docker-seedbox/ && cd "$_"
chmod +x server-fresh-install.sh
./server-fresh-install.sh
```
That's it

## Seedbox docker stack installation on existing server

If git is not installed :
```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install git
```
then clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shinsentoh/seedbox.git /opt/docker-seedbox/ && cd "$_"
chmod +x docker-fresh-install.sh
./docker-fresh-install.sh
```

## Running & updating docker containers

```sh
./update-all.sh
```

docker-compose should manage all the volumes and network setup for you. If it
does not, verify that your docker and docker-compose version is updated.

Make sure you install the dependencies and finish configuration before doing
this.

## PlexPass

Just set the `VERSION` environment variable to `latest` on the Plex service (enabled by default).
See https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex.

## Where is my data?

All data is saved in the docker volumes `config` or `torrents` and `media`.
These volumes are mapped to the `config` and `torrents` folders located on the host in `$BASE_PATH` directory which is a variable you can change in the .env file and the docker-compose.yml file.
Thanks to the **local-persist** Docker plugin, the data located in these volumes is persistent, meaning that volumes are not deleted, even when using the ```docker-compose down``` command. It would be a shame to loose everything by running a simple docker command ;-)
